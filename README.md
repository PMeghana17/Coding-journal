# Coding-journal

Welcome to my daily coding journey! This repository is a collection of all my coding practice, solutions, and learnings, starting from day 1.

## How It Works

- Every day, I add a new folder
  - Code solutions in Java
  - Notes about what I learned or found challenging
  - Links to resources I found helpful
  - And my daily wrap up
 
// Following DSA Strivers A2Z Sheet

Also Started following GFG 160 days course
-Daily solving 1 problem from that course.
-Readme contains the exact solutions (Naive,Better and Optimal) 
-But .java files contains my codes.
