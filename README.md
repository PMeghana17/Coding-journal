# Coding-journal

Welcome to my daily coding journey! This repository is a collection of all my coding practice, solutions, and learnings, starting from day 1.

## How It Works

- Every day, I add a new folder
  - Code solutions in Java
  - Notes about what I learned or found challenging
  - Links to resources I found helpful
  - And my daily wrap up
